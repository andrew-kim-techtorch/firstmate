# Regression coverage for the heredoc-in-command-substitution parse bug (issue
# #166): each ship-mode branch builds its Definition-of-done text with
# `VAR=$(cat <<EOF ... EOF)`. Bash's lexer tracks quote state through the
# heredoc body while it scans for the matching `)` of the command
# substitution, so a single unescaped apostrophe anywhere in that body breaks
# parsing of the *entire rest of the script* - `bash -n` fails, not just the
# generated brief. A plain `cat > file <<EOF ... EOF` (not wrapped in `$(...)`)
# is unaffected, so the secondmate charter block does not need this guard.
